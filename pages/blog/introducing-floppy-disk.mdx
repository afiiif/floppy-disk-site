# Introducing Floppy Disk

The Zustand-ReactQuery alternative for local, global, sync, or async state management.

## Why?

In the beginning, I made this library just as part of my learning journey.
Not trying to re-invent the wheel, but I just **want to challange myself** whether I can build something like that.

I always thought [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) & [TanStack-Query](https://tanstack.com/query) (a.k.a React-Query) were really cool.
I love the simplicity of Zustand.
I am truly impressed with the completeness of the features offered by React-Query.
So, it will be a really huge challange to replicate both functionalities.

In the end, I managed to replicate more than 90% of their functionalities ([see comparison](/docs/comparison)),
with the developer experience I desired, and some additional advantages.

## How?

1. **Zustand-Query**

In the initial phase, I try to re-create something like React-Query using Zustand.
A "Zutand-Query" ðŸ˜†.
But then I encountered difficulties because in Zustand, there is no store "key" that can be used as a query key.
I feel like there is no way out unless I create something like Zustand, but with more power.

2. **Zustand++**

As I mentioned previously, finally I create a Zustand-like state manager, but with more features:

<div>
- Not only can create a "store", but it also can create "stores" that can be controlled by a store key.
- Added store event handler: `onSubscribe`, `onUnsubscribe`, `onFirstSubscribe`, `onLastUnsubscribe`.
</div>

3. **Go Deeper Into React-Query and SWR**

In this phase, I learned about:
how to serialize a query key into a string,
the different options naming between React-Query & SWR,
the behavior of bi-directional query,
race-condition prevention, React suspense, and many more.

4. **The Born of Floppy Disk**

Finally I managed to create:

- A global state manager just like Zustand.
- A data fetching state manager just like TanStack Query & SWR, but it tastes like Zustand.
- A smaller bundle size package.

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'; // 3.3 kB (gzipped: 1.5 kB)
import { createStore } from 'floppy-disk'; // 1.4 kB (gzipped: 714 B) ðŸŽ‰

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider, useQuery, useInfiniteQuery, useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query'; // 41 kB (gzipped: 11 kB)
import { createQuery, createMutation } from 'floppy-disk'; // 9.5 kB (gzipped: 3.2 kB) ðŸŽ‰
```

I want to explain the **developer experience** part and the **additional advantages** part.

### Query Key & Query Function

I'm not a fan of the experience in React-Query regarding the use of a **query key** to refer a query.
It's a bit difficult to ensure its uniqueness.
In React-Query, we can't be 100% sure if there is no duplicate query key,
even if we already use [Query Key factories](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/effective-react-query-keys#use-query-key-factories).

```jsx
const MY_QUERY = 'my-query';
const MY_OTHER_QUERY = 'my-query'; // ðŸ”´

const myQuery = useQuery([MY_QUERY], myQueryFn);
const myOtherQuery = useQuery([MY_OTHER_QUERY], otherFunction); // ðŸ”´

const state = queryClient.getQueryState({ queryKey: MY_QUERY });
//    ^ Is this state comes from myQueryFn or otherFunction?
```

In Floppy Disk, we refer a query with the query object itself, no ambiguity:

```jsx
const useQuery = createQuery(myQueryFn);
const myOtherQuery = createQuery(otherFunction);

useQuery.get();
myOtherQuery.get();
useQuery.invalidate();
myOtherQuery.invalidate();
```

### Optimistic Update

Floppy Disk gives a simpler code for optimistic update,
which automatically cancel the pending query to prevent race condition,
and return a revert & invalidate function.

```jsx
const { revert, invalidate } = useProfileQuery.optimisticUpdate({
  response: payload,
});

// Specific id:
const { revert, invalidate } = useProductDetailQuery.optimisticUpdate({
  key: { id: payload.id },
  response: payload,
});
```

### Bi-Directional Query

In Floppy Disk, bi-directional query is treated like 2 independent infinite query.
So, we can start refetch from the initial page and have a parallel refeching for next & previous pages.
Therefore, we can obtain the information in which direction we are fetching/refetching.

<section className="pt-6 pb-2 -mb-2 overflow-x-auto -mr-6">
<div className="flex gap-3 [&_ol]:!mt-0 text-sm [&_p_strong]:text-base">

<div className="p-3 border rounded min-w-[15rem]">

**React-Query:**

Initial:

1. Initial fetch (page 5)
2. Fetch next (page 6)
3. Fetch previous (page 4)

Pages: [4, 5, 6]

Refetch:

1. Refetch (page 4)
2. Fetch next (page 5)
3. Fetch next (page 6)

</div>
<div className="p-3 border rounded min-w-[16rem]">

**Floppy Disk:**

Initial:

1. Initial fetch (page 5)
2. Fetch next (page 6)
3. Fetch previous (page 4)

Pages: \{ next: [5, 6], prev: [4] \}

Refetch:

1. **Refetch initial page** (page 5)
2. Fetch next pages (page 6) and previous pages (page 4) parallelly sequentially

</div>

</div>
</section>

It was inspired from this issue: https://github.com/TanStack/query/issues/1401.

### Misc.

There are some other improvement:

<div>
- A simplified DX for [infinite query](/docs/query/paginated-or-infinite-query)
- A better [query state explanation](/docs/query/introduction#query-state--network-fetching-state)
- More ways to handle `onSuccess` / `onError` in [mutation](/docs/mutation/introduction)
- Easier to control subscription (re-render)
- And a lot more, [see docs](/docs/getting-started)
</div>

<div className="h-6" />

## Epilogue

[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) & [React-Query](https://tanstack.com/query) are awesome production-ready library.
If you love both libraries, then I think you should **try** [Floppy Disk](/), but might not need to switch to it,
unless it really solved the problem you encounted when using Zustand/React-Query.

<div className="text-sm pt-12 opacity-80">
Anyway, why is it called "Floppy Disk"?<br/>
I put a data in it, and it was a tiny store, then "Floppy Disk" comes to my mind.
