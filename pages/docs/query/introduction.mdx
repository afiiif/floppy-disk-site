# Query

With the power of `createStores` function, we can easily create a hook just like `useQuery` and `useInfiniteQuery` in [TanStack-Query](https://tanstack.com/query) using `createQuery` function.

It can dedupe multiple request, handle caching, auto-update stale data, handle retry on error, handle infinite query, and many more.
With the flexibility given in `createStores`, we can extend its power according to our needs.

## Query State & Network Fetching State

First of all, we need to understand the difference between these 2 types:

- Query data state
- Network fetching state

The query data state represented as `status`, `isLoading`, `isSuccess`, `isError`.
These values has **no relation** with network fetching state. ‚ö†Ô∏è

For network fetching state, we use `isWaiting`.
The value will be `true` if the query is called and still waiting for the response.
Here is the flow of both states:

<QueryStateFlow />

<Callout emoji="üí°">
**IMPORTANT NOTE:**<br/>
By default, when `isWaiting` value is changed, the subscribers or the component which use the hook **will not be notified**.
We can change this behavior by setting up the `defaultDeps`, or set it on specific component (in the dependency array).
</Callout>

## Response Vs Data

```tsx
const { isSuccess, data, response } = useMyQuery();
```

The `response` represents the untouched response returned from the async function.
On the other hand, the `data` represents the customized selection of the response obtained using the `select` option.
If we didn't define the `select` option, `data` will be equal to `response`.

## Inherited from createStores

The `createQuery` function inherits functionality from the `createStores` function, allowing us to perform the same result and actions available in `createStores`.

```tsx
const useMyQuery = createQuery(
  fetchMyData,
  {
    // üëá Same as createStores options
    defaultDeps: undefined,
    onFirstSubscribe: (state) => console.log('onFirstSubscribe', state),
    onSubscribe: (state) => console.log('onSubscribe', state),
    onUnsubscribe: (state) => console.log('onUnsubscribe', state),
    onLastUnsubscribe: (state) => console.log('onLastUnsubscribe', state),
    onBeforeChangeKey: (nextKey, prevKey) => console.log('Store key changed', nextKey, prevKey),

    // ... other createQuery options (explained on next chapter)
  },
);
```

Custom reactivity (dependency array):

```tsx
function QueryLoader() {
  // This component doesn't care whether the query is success or error.
  // It just listening to network fetching state. üëá
  const { isWaiting } = useMyQuery((state) => [state.isWaiting]);
  return <div>Is network fetching? {String(isWaiting)}</div>;
}
```

Actions outside component:

```tsx
useMyQuery.get( /* ... */ );
useMyQuery.set( /* ... */ );
useMyQuery.subscribe( /* ... */ );
useMyQuery.getSubscribers( /* ... */ );
```

## Fresh & Stale Query Concept

A query categorized as a fresh or stale depends on the comparison between the stale time config and the current time.
For example, we use the default stale time, which is **3 seconds**.

```tsx
const useMyQuery = createQuery(fetchMyData);
const { fetch, forceFetch } = useMyQuery.get();
```

<section className="[&>ul>li]:my-5 [&>ul_ul>li]:list-[square]">
- `07:00 AM` ‚Äì fetch the data
- `07:01 AM` ‚Äì get the response
  <div className="pt-2 text-sm">(Since stale time is 3 seconds, the query will be categorized as fresh until `07:04 AM`)</div>
- `07:02 AM to 07:04 AM` üü¢ _fresh_
  - By default, when a component which use the hook is mounted, the query function will not get invoked.
  - By default, when a window focus event triggered, the query function will not get invoked.
  - Calling `fetch()` won't affect anything.
  - Calling `forceFetch()` will call the query function.
- `07:05 AM onwards` üü† _stale_
  - By default, when a component which use the hook is mounted, the query function will get invoked.
  - By default, when a window focus event triggered, the query function will get invoked.
</section>
